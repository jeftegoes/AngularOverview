# 1. What is this project?

- It is a small/simple project that demonstrates how it is possible to create different views (Roles) in the front-end in Angular according to what is returned by the back-end in C# using the JWT authentication method (JSON Web Tokens).

# 2. Some requirements:

- 3 user levels/views: Admin, Customer and Employee, completely independent;
- In the back-end some methods need to be restricted to their respective rules (Roles);
- Methods for Anonymous users.
- Methods common to all, but internally a specific test for a type of rule.

# 3. Back-end

.Net Core 3.1

# 4. Front-end

Angular 4+ (10)
